# VRCW Foundation

This package is a foundation framework package for creating VRChat worlds with Udon(sharp). It contains several utilities and pipeline extensions that extends functionality on Udon(Sharp) and VRChat World SDK.

It originates from my own utility set for world gimmicks, and then bundled and developed as a part of VizVid, but then I think it should have its own codespace that can be shared across different projects without direct dependency to VizVid.

Documentations on each tools/utilities will be available once the project structure has been solidified and all codes are refactored for general use.
